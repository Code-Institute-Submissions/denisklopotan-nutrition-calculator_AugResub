## User Experience Design (UX)

## Features

Nutrition calculator able to take input for 4 values per article, 2 articles in total, add them together and return sum total.

## Future Enhancements

Expand on calculator able to take input for 'n' number of articles.
After second article offer choice screen, continue or calculate.

## Testing

Project was manually tested for for code validation at [PEP8 online.](http://pep8online.com)
Project passed validator testing for all PEP8 requirements. ![Validator Testing](/PEP8.jpeg)

## Deployment

Heroku is a platform designed to host dynamic websites. While Github pages is a great hosting platform for  
projects built entirely with front end languages  like HTML, CSS and JavaScript, it's not built  
to handle back end languages like Python, which  is why we're using Heroku for this deployment. The live link can be found here: https://nutrition-calculator-2.herokuapp.com/

## Acknowledgements

Big thanks to m y mentor Jack who had a hard time with me and my late minute projects but still kept very friendly and professional and always looked to troubleshoot and find the best posible solution. Atctually that part of mentoring meant to me much more than just data. I realised programming isv very alive discipline where you need to always asess present moment and bring best posible solutions.. Many many thanks
