## User Experience Design (UX)

Code Institute mock terminal on Heroku.

## Features

Nutrition calculator able to take input for 4 values per article, 2 articles in total, add them together and return sum total.

## Future Enhancements

- Make code that can take input for 'n' number of articles. Which means calculating more than just 2 inputs.
- After second input provide option to continue adding articles or calculate current inputs.
- Make it able to restart calculator from terminal, not just with mockup button.
- Possibility for an mobile app.

## Technologies Used

- [HTML5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5)
- [CSS3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS)
- [Python](https://www.python.org/) 
- [GitHub](https://github.com/)
- [GitPod](https://www.gitpod.io/)
- [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com)
- [Chrome DevTools](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/)

## Testing

Project was manually tested for for code validation at [PEP8 online.](http://pep8online.com)
Project passed validator testing for all PEP8 requirements. ![Validator Testing](/PEP8.jpeg)

## Deployment

### Github

### Heroku

[Heroku](https://www.heroku.com) is a platform designed to host dynamic websites. While Github pages is a great hosting platform for  
projects built entirely with front end languages  like HTML, CSS and JavaScript, it's not built  
to handle back end languages like Python, which  is why we're using Heroku for this deployment.

Alongside Code institute material and LMS i used following pages for general learning and understanding of python:
- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/)
- [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/) channels:
  - [Freecodecamp](https://www.youtube.com/c/Freecodecamp)

## Acknowledgements

Big thanks to my mentor Jack Wachira who was trully put to test with my last minute projects and deadlines. :D (btw., he passed with highest grades! ;)
He troubleshoot not just with my project but with life situations and personality, and showed what programming actually is. It is a mindset. A mindset that you can apply to anything in life. That is by biggest take from this, for which im very grateful.

CI slack community, what to say..always there to help and motivate eachother, its one big geek family that i grew fond of.

Tutor support helping from different time zones or opposite sides of the world at late evenings or early mornings haha :D

All of mentioned made me appreciate and love this experience with CI and programming. I actually start to see myself as programmer and feel comfortable with it. And this is very big change.

Many many thanks.. :)
